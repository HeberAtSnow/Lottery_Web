This program is a Web-App that simulates PowerBall Lottery sales

The solution will require students to demonstrate:
- SpecFlow for test cases
- Thread-Safe concurrency for multi-threaded responses
- Linq for sorting/aggregating
- SeriLog for application logging

Class purposes:
- LotteryProgram
	Main container for holding
		LotteryPeriod p
		LotteryVendor v
		ResetPeriod() -> method for re-initializing a Period
		tLotteryVendor() -> Thread start for vendor mass-purchasing tickets
		tStatsCompilers() -> Thread start for calculating winning
- LotteryPeriod
		DrawWinningTicket()
		ResultsByPlayer(s)
		ResultsByWinLevel()
		ComputeWinners()
		NumberMatchingWhiteBalls(l)
		CheckWinningTicket(l);
- LotteryVendor
		SellTicket(s,balls)
		SellTicket(s)
		SellQuickTicket(s,num)
		purchaseTickets(p,int)  --ThreadSafe way of purchasing mass tickets
- LotteryTicket
		

		flag for threads to sell tickets ->   if that is OK
			then ticket sales are OK  (push ahoy!)
			else  -  if thread doing mass sales - he dies 
			      - if http request - returns 408...  in wrong state

		ResetPeriod (...after stats.  set flat to sellisOK)
